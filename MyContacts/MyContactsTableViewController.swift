///I was under the impression that this code was mandatory for the other conversion function but I commented it out and everything still seems to have the proper colors so perhaps I was incorrect.

The reason we saw those ugly looking corners on the window after class was because of this rectangle. By changing it to about 36 (which was simply a random number I entered to test the code) seemed to make it fill the alert window perfectly. This is because the code seems to fillet down the corners of the rectangle. But what I think i really cool about this code is that it can be used to create some interesting gradient effects, for example try changing the value from 36 to 90 and then run the app and you'll see what I mean on the corners of the alert window. this code is worth playing around with.
